# Movie

# Initial Design

## Idea:

An application (web and mobile) to help you pick a movie when you just cannot decide.

## Implementation

A REST API in Node.js, which will be interacted with a frontend of either Angular 2, or React (TBD). Once we have
determined a front end, we will choose the respective hybrid mobile framework to go with it (Ionic 2 or React Native).
